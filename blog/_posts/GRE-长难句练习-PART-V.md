## 句子、段落与文章，四级托福 GRE。

## I 

1. The compositional similarity of the Moon and Earth's mantle and the recognized importance of large impacts in the early solar system, together with the large angular momentum present in the Earth-Moon system, have led to **the theory** that the Moon formed after a Mars-sized object collided with the growing Earth. 

   > (The compositional **similarity** of the <u>Moon and Earth's mantle</u>) ***and*** (the recognized **importance** of large impacts in the early solar system), [~~together with the large angular momentum present in the Earth-Moon system~~], ***have led to*** **<u>the theory</u>** that the Moon formed after a Mars-sized object collided with the growing Earth. 
   >
   > 月球和地球地幔组成的相似性和早期太阳系大冲撞公认的重要性，加上地月系统中存在的巨大的角动量，已经引出一个理论：月球是在一个火星大小的物体与成长中的地球撞击后产生的。
   >
   > ⁉️：得出结论：地球被火星大小物品撞了后产生了月球。

2. Simulations predict that much of the preexisting layered structure of Earth was obliterated and much of the impacting material thrown back into orbit, creating a post-impact accretion disk surrounding proto-Earth. 

   > **Simulations** *predict* <u>that much of the **preexisting layered structure** of Earth ***was obliterated*** and much of the **impacting material** ***thrown back into orbit***, [~~creating a post-impact accretion disk surrounding proto-Earth~~].</u> 
   >
   > 模拟预测：大多数先前存在的地球的层状结构已经被抹除并且大多数撞击材料被抛回轨道。

3. Simulations also predict that the Moon consists primarily of material from the impacting object, and not material from proto-Earth. 

   > **Simulations** also *predict* <u>that the **Moon** ***consists*** primarily of material from the impacting object, and not material from proto-Earth.</u> 
   >
   > 模拟也预测：月球主要由撞击物体的材料组成并且没有来自原始地球的材料。

4. This computational model is challenged, however, by a **remarkable similarity** in oxygen isotopes found between lunar and Earth rocks, raising questions about the partitioning of material during impact.

   > This **computational model** *is* <u>challenged</u>, however, by a **remarkable similarity** in oxygen isotopes found between lunar and Earth rocks, **raising** *questions* about the partitioning of material during impact.
   >
   > 这个计算的模型是有缺陷的，然而，通过在月球和地球岩石上发现的及其相似的氧的同位素，增加了对于在冲击过程中物质的分配。

### I-I

According to the passage, the "**remarkable similarity**" best suggests that

😿 Earth did not collide with a Mars-sized object

> 地球没和火星大小的东西撞 【明显不对，撞了肯定是撞了】

✅ the object that collided with Earth did not provide most of the Moon's material

> 这东西和地球撞了之后没有给月亮提供太多的材料 【只能选这个了，解释就是：原文开始说大多数都是撞击的物体提供的材料，给甩上去了，但是后面的质疑就揭示了可能是地球提供的。】

😿 Earth's layered structure was largely obliterated by a collision

> 地球的层级结构被碰撞干掉了 【确实，但是貌似和 remarkable similarity 没什么关系】

😿 Earth and its Moon were formed at approximately the same time

> 地球和月亮大约形成在同一时间。【我认为看不出来】

😿 the object that collided with Earth was probably not Mars-sized

> 和地球撞的物体大概没有火星这么大。【文中并没有说体积的事儿】

### I-II

Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about "**the theory**"?

✅ It is not contradicted by the similarity in oxygen isotopes found between lunar and Earth rocks.

> 在月球和地球岩石上发现氧的同位素并不与 the theory 矛盾。【我觉得对，因为 the theory 只是说明地球被撞过】

😿 It is based primarily on the large angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system.

> 它主要基于地月间巨大的角动量 【原文说到角动量和另一个理论可以退出 the theory 但是，没法证明是 primarily】

😿 It has been undermined by recent computer simulations of an object colliding with proto-Earth.

> 最近计算机模拟的一个物体与原地球相撞破坏了这一理论。【不对，计算机模拟支持这个理论】

😿 It is unable to account for the formation of an accretion disk around proto-Earth.

> 没法解释原始地球周围的 disk 的形成。【错，可以解释。】

😿 It is difficult to reconcile with the compositional similarity of the Moon and Earth's mantle.

> 与月球和地球地幔的组成的相似性是很难协调统一的。【不对，地球月球组成同意是 the theory 的前提之一。后面质疑 computer simulation 只是在说月球带出来的材料是撞击物的还是地球的而已。】

## III

1. When an old tree was felled, a very thin ring was detected among the oldest rings in the stump. 

   > When an old tree was felled, **a very thin ring** *was detected* among the oldest rings in the stump. 
   >
   > 当最老的树倒下时，一个非常细的环在树桩中的最古老的环中被发现。

2. When the width of rings, each corresponding to one year's growth, was correlated with local rainfall records, it was found, as expected, that thicker rings had occurred in years with abundant rain. 

   > <u>When **the width of rings**,</u> [~~each corresponding to one year's growth~~], <u>*was correlated with* local rainfall records</u>, **it** *was found*, [~~as expected~~], <u>that **thicker rings** *had occurred in* years with abundant rain.</u>

😿 The decrease of light in rainy years was not a factor that would have limited the growth of the tree.

> 在多雨年份里的光的下降不是一个限制树的成长的因素。
>
> 原文也没说光的事情。

😿 Some species of trees have methods of storing water between years, and thus the thickness of their rings does not vary with year-to-year rainfall.

> 一些种类的树有较强的储水能力，并且因此他们的环的粗细并不随着降雨而变化。
>
> 

😿 There is independent evidence to suggest that the local patterns of rainfall changed significantly over the lifetime of the tree.

> 存在独立的证据表示：本地降雨模式在树的一生中显著变化

   >
   > 

3. They only thrive in a carefully nurtured context-hospitable human spaces that invite lingering and revisiting-which is why the genius of the best curators is in their eye for juxtaposition and presentation as much as it is in scholarship and acquisition. 

4. Architecture needs to be strong and confident; but the instant museum architecture becomes **ostentatiously strong and overconfident**, the art is going to wither. 

5. The Tate Modern is a building that will not stop speaking and let us attend to the art.

### IV-I

**For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.**

The passage implies that a problem with "**ostentatiously strong and overconfident**" architecture for art museums is that viewers will

😿 avoid certain museums that they otherwise would have visited 

😿 linger excessively in order to appreciate the building's architecture

😿 find themselves distracted from paying attention to the art

### IV-II

**For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.**

## V

1. Despite **clues** that a single master building plan tied Egypt's Sphinx to the pyramid and temples built by the pharaoh Khafre (who reigned from 2520 to 2494 b.c.), some archaeologists continued to speculate that other pharaohs built the statue. 
2. In 1980, however, German geologist Tom Aigner suggested a novel way of showing that the Sphinx was an integral part of Khafre's larger building complex. 
3. Examining the fossil fingerprints of **limestone samples** from the Sphinx and the nearby Sphinx Temple attributed to Khafre, Aigner traced the blocks used to build the wall of the temple to the ditch surrounding the Sphinx. 
4. It would seem that workmen hauled away the quarried blocks to construct the temple as the Sphinx was being carved out of the stone.

### V-I

The passage suggests which of the following about the "**clues**"?

😿 They intensified debates over the Sphinx's origin.

😿 They undermined the theory that attributed the Sphinx to Khafre.

😿 They failed to convince a number of archaeologists.

😿 They indicated that the Sphinx was built after 2494 b.c.

😿 They were an integral part of Aigner's solution.

### V-II

According to the passage, the "**limestone samples**" allowed Aigner to establish

😿 the identity of the pharaoh who built the Sphinx Temple

😿 the origins of the material used to build the Sphinx Temple

😿 the techniques used in the Sphinx's construction

😿 the interval between the completion of the Sphinx and the construction of its surrounding structures

😿 the differences between the materials used to build the Sphinx and those used to build its surrounding structures
