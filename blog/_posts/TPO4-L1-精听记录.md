## 连读导致的听不懂

* So the displacement activity, the, the grooming, **<u>the straightening of its feathers</u>** seems to be <u>an</u> irrelevant behavior.

  N-of-iz

* <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:orange"></i> But that's not <u>***an irrelevant or inappropriate***</u> behavior—the behavior makes sense—it’s appropriate <u>***under the***</u> circumstances, but what doesn't make sense is <u>***the object the behavior's directed towards.***</u>

  The behavior's directed towards 做 object 定语？

* Professor, <u>***isn't***</u> it possible that animals groom because they<u>'ve gotten **messed up a** little ***from***</u> fighting or mating?

* The immediate environment of the bird—its immediate, um, <u>***its relationship to its immediate environment***</u> seems to play a part in which behavior it will display.

## 句型或单词不熟悉导致的听不懂

* You may have seen, for example, a bird <u>that's</u> in the middle of <u>a</u> **mating ritual**.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74922_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

* And, and suddenly it stops and preens--you know, ***<u>it</u>*** take<u>***s a***</u> few <u>moments</u> to straighten <u>***its***</u> feathers--and <u>then</u> returns to the mating ritual.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74923_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

* This kind of behavior-- <u>***this***</u> doing something <u>***that seems***</u> completely **out of place**--is what we call <u>***a***</u> displacement activity.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74924_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

* <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:orange"></i> Displacement occurs because the animal's got two conflicting drives, two competing urges, in this case, fear and hunger—and what happens is <u>they inhibit each other</u>—<u>they **cancel** each other **out** in a way</u>, and a third, <u>***seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces … through a process that***</u> we call disinhibition.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74942_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

  **意：**而此时第三方，似乎毫无相关的行为就会出现，我们称之为“抑制解除”。

  Surface 还能做动词，和 emerge 一个意思

* <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:orange"></i> Now, in disinhibition, the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit, to <u>***hold back***</u> a third drive, well, well, they <u>**get in the way**</u> of each other in a, in a conflict situation, and somehow lose control, lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior…which means that the third drive surfaces...it-it's <u>expressed in</u> the animal's behavior.

  **意：**而抑制解除，基本上的意思是两种驱动似乎会抑制或克制第三种驱动。或者，嗯，他们会在一种冲突的情况下相互阻碍，有时会失去控制，失去对第三种行为的抑制作用。它表现在动物的行为上。

* What's interesting is that studie<u>***s have***</u> been done that suggest that the animal<u>***'s***</u> environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays.

* <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true" style="color:orange"></i> For example, there's a bird–the wood thrush, anyway when the wood thrush is in an attack-escape conflict—that is, it's caught between the two urges to escape from or attack an enemy—if it's sitting on a horizontal branch, <u>***it'll***</u> <u>**wipe**</u> its beak on its perch.

## 弱读 & 略读导致的听不懂

* So what do you think another example of <u>***a***</u> displacement activity might be?

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74929_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

* How about <u>***an***</u> animal that, um, instead of fighting <u>its</u> enemy or running away, it attack<u>***s a***</u> plant or <u>***a***</u> bush?

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/1839/74931_20180614192852.mp3" controls></audio>

  

## 疑难杂症

* I think I read in another class about an experiment, um, where an object that the animal was afraid of <u>was put next to its</u> food—next to the animal's food—and the animal, <u>***it was conflicted between confronting the object, and eating the food***</u>, so instead it just fell asleep. Like that?

*  Maybe because it's easy for them to do—I mean, grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do—it’s something they do all the time, and they have the–the stimulus right there, on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming—or if food is right in front of them.
