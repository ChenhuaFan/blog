#### 错题部分：

1. It should be obvious that cetaceans-whales, porpoises, and dolphins-are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.

   **Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about early sea otters?**

   A. It is not difficult to imagine what they looked like

   B. There were great numbers of them.

   C. They lived in the sea only.

   <p style="color:red">D. They did not leave many fossil remains</p>

2. The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte, an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the Pakicetus fossil precious details on the origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh- eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. It probably bred and gave birth on land.

   **Pakicetus and modern cetaceans have similar**

   <p style="color:red">A. Hearing structures</p>

   B. Adaptations for diving

   C. Skull shapes

   D. Breeding locations

3. These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly \$1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately \$10 to \$15 each). He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.

   **The author discusses phonograph parlors in paragraph 2 in order to**

   <p style="color:red">A. Explain Edison's financial success</p>

   B. Describe the model used to design Kinetoscope parlors

   C. Contrast their popularity to that of Kinetoscope parlors

   D. Illustrate how much more technologically advanced Kinetoscope parlors were

4. With the advent of projection, the viewer's relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. **It** suddenly became public-an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator looked at expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.

   **The word **"it"** in the passage refers to**

   A. The advent of projection

   B. The viewer's relationship with the image

   <p style="color:red">C. A similar machine</p>

   D. Celluloid

#### 解析部分:

1. **A**。太菜了，被简单逻辑绕晕。unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds，it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. 后半句说不是很容易去想象第一个鲸长啥样，前面一句再来一个反向 unlike。大概就是 不像 otters 第一个鲸很难想象。也就是 otters 容易。而D的化石说的是鲸，跟 otter 没关系（都已经下一句话了）
2. **C**。The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. 这句话没理解到位，skull is cetacean-like 已经很明显了，后面又说 jawbones **lack** … 已经 lack 了怎么会相似？是现代鲸鱼用于接受声音，前者不存在这种东西。
3. **B**。这题关键是 Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly \$1,000 apiece) to these **parlors** than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately \$10 to \$15 each).  这句话没读明白。parlor 放映厅。 [films的概念](https://www.zhihu.com/question/20180196/answer/15577906) 这句话理解后，这题就很明显了。如果想说明爱迪生的经济成功，那么也应该有 phonograph parlors 和他自己的那玩意所带来的不同的利润差。而第一句就给出了B选项的出处。
4. **B**。题型分类：指代题；题干分析：指代关系，找前一句的主语，结合上句可得出It指代的是"the viewer’s relationship with the image(观者与影像的关系)"，它不再私人化，而是逐渐公开化。因此选择B。 dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. 这段意思是 其他人，至少指人。
