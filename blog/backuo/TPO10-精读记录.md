## Passage one: Chinese Pottery

**China** <u>has</u> one of the world's oldest continuous *<u>civilizations</u>*-despite invasions and occasional foreign rule. A **country** as vast as China with so long-lasting a civilization <u>has</u> a complex <u>*social*</u> and visual <u>*history*</u>, within which pottery and porcelain play a major role.

中国拥有世界上最古老的且连续的文明，尽管(存在)入侵和偶尔的外来者统治。一个类似于中国具有如此长的文明的国家有一个复杂的社会和可见的历史，陶器和瓷器在其中扮演了重要角色。

The function and status of ceramics in China varied from dynasty to dynasty, so they may be utilitarian, burial, trade-collectors', or even ritual objects, according to their quality and the era in which they were made. The ceramics fall into three broad types-<u>***earthenware***</u>, <u>***stoneware***</u>, and <u>***porcelain***</u>-for vessels, architectural items such as roof tiles, and modeled objects and figures. In addition, there was an important group of sculptures made for religious use, the majority of which were produced in earthenware.

中国瓷器的功能和质量随朝代变化而变化，因此根据他们的质量和他们所被制造的朝代，(他们)可能是功利性的，埋葬的，贸易者的，甚至是宗教物品。这些瓷器可以被分为广义的 3 类——<u>***陶器***</u>，<u>***石器***</u>和<u>***瓷器***</u>——用于容器，建筑物品例如屋顶瓦片，和物体或人体的模型。此外，还存在一个重要的雕像群被制造用于宗教使用，其中绝大多数是陶器。

The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware temperatures, but as early as the fifteenth century B.C., high-temperature stonewares were being made with <u>***glazed surfaces***</u>. During the Six Dynasties period (AD 265-589), <u>***kilns***</u> in north China were producing high-fired ceramics of good quality. <u>***Whitewares***</u> produced in Hebei and Henan provinces from the seventh to the tenth centuries evolved into the highly prized porcelains of the Song dynasty (AD.1960-1279), long regarded as one of the high points in the history of China's ceramic industry. **The tradition of religious sculpture *<u>extends over</u>* most historical periods but is less clearly <u>*delineated*</u> than that of stonewares or porcelains, for it <u>*embraces*</u> the old custom of earthenware burial <u>*ceramics*</u> with later religious images and architectural <u>*ornament*</u>.** Ceramic products also include lead-glazed tomb models of the Han dynasty, three-color lead-glazed vessels and figures of the Tang dynasty, and Ming three-color temple ornaments, in which the motifs were outlined in a raised trail of slip-as well as the many burial ceramics produced in imitation of vessels made in materials of higher intrinsic value.

最早的瓷器被烧制在陶器温度下，但是早在公元前 15 世纪，高温石器已经拥有<u>***釉质表面***</u>。在 6 朝时期，中国北部<u>***窑***</u>已经生产具有高品质的高温瓷器。由河北和河南省在 7 世纪到 10 世纪生产的<u>***白色瓷器***</u>发展到具有高度价值的宋朝瓷器，长期被认为是中国瓷器工业历史上的最高点之一。**宗教雕塑的传统<u>*延续了*</u>历史上的大部分时期，但却没有石器或瓷器那么<u>*清晰*</u>，因为它<u>*包含*</u>了陶器葬陶的古老习俗，后来又加入了宗教形象和建筑<u>*装饰*</u>。**{% asset_img 2.png [句子精读] %}瓷器产品也包括汉代的铅釉棺材模型，唐朝的 3 色铅釉容器和人物，和明朝的泥釉凸纹展现轮廓的三彩寺庙装饰以及很多用来仿制贵重器皿的陪葬瓷器。{% asset_img 1.png [句子精读] %}

Trade between the West and the settled and prosperous Chinese dynasties introduced new forms and different technologies. One of the most <u>***far-reaching***</u> examples is the impact of the fine ninth-century AD.Chinese <u>***porcelain wares***</u> imported into the Arab world. <u>So admired were these pieces that they encouraged the development of earthenware made in imitation of porcelain and instigated research into the method of their manufacture.</u> From the Middle East the Chinese acquired a blue pigment-a purified form of cobalt oxide unobtainable at that time in China-that contained only a low level of manganese. Cobalt ores found in China have a high manganese content, which produces a more <u>***muted***</u> blue-gray color. In the seventeenth century, the trading activities of the Dutch East India Company <u>***resulted in***</u> vast quantities of decorated Chinese porcelain being brought to Europe, which stimulated and influenced the work of a wide variety of wares, notably Delft. The Chinese themselves adapted many specific vessel forms from the West, such as bottles with long spouts, and designed a range of decorative patterns especially for the European market.

在西方与稳定且富裕的中国间的贸易介绍了新种类和不同的科技。其中一个最具有<u>***深远的***</u>例子是9 世纪极佳的影响。中国的<u>***瓷器制品***</u>进口到了阿拉伯世界。(so adj … that … 部分倒装) 这些物件太引人注目以至于他们被鼓励发展了陶瓷的仿制并且激励研究他们制作工艺方法。来自中东，中国需要一种蓝色染料——一种从那时中国无法获得的氧化钴中提纯的——(氧化钴)包含含量很低的猛。在中国发现的钴矿石含有很高的锰，可以产生一种更<u>***暗***</u>蓝灰色颜色。在 17 世纪，荷兰东印度公司的贸易活动<u>***导致***</u>巨大数量的经过装饰的中国瓷器被带往欧洲，(这个)刺激并影响了广泛的瓷器制作，尤其是戴尔福特。中国自己适应了许多种特别的来自西方的器具形式，例如：带有长嘴儿的瓶子，并且设计了一系列专为欧洲市场设计的装饰模式。

Just as painted designs on Greek pots may seem today to be purely decorative, whereas in fact they were carefully and precisely worked out so that at the time, their meaning was clear, so it is with Chinese pots. To twentieth-century eyes, Chinese pottery may appear merely decorative, yet to the Chinese the form of each object and its adornment had meaning and significance. The dragon represented the emperor, and the phoenix, the empress; the <u>***pomegranate***</u> indicated <u>***fertility***</u>, and a pair of fish, happiness; <u>***mandarin ducks***</u> stood for <u>***wedded bliss***</u>; the pine tree, peach, and crane are emblems of long life; and fish leaping from waves indicated success in the <u>***civil service examinations***</u>. <u>***Only***</u> when European decorative themes were <u>***introduced***</u> did these meanings become obscured or even lost.

正如在希腊陶器上的绘画设计在今天看起来更加像单纯的装饰，然而事实上在那时他们更加小心并精确地绘制，他们的含义是清晰的，因此中国的瓷器也是这样。以 20 世纪的眼光来看，中国瓷器也许只是展示了装饰性的，而对于中国人来说每一个物体的形式和他的装饰有含义和重要性。龙代表皇帝，并且凤凰代表女王，<u>***石榴***</u>指明<u>***多子***</u>，并且一对儿鱼表示幸福。<u>***鸳鸯***</u>代表<u>***婚姻的极乐***</u>；桃子树，桃子和仙鹤是长寿的象征；鱼跃出水面表示在<u>***公务员考试***</u>成功。<u>***但是***</u>欧洲的装饰主题<u>***被引进***</u>后，这些寓意就变得不再那么流行甚至丢失了。(only conj. 但是，可是，不过)

From early times pots were used in both religious and <u>***secular contexts***</u>. The <u>***imperial court commissioned***</u> work and in the Yuan dynasty (A.D.1279-1368) an imperial ceramic factory was established at Jingdezhen. Pots played an important part in some religious ceremonies. Long and often <u>***lyrical***</u> descriptions of the different types of ware exist that assist in classifying pots, although these sometimes confuse an already large and complicated picture.

从早期陶器被用于宗教和<u>***世俗背景***</u>。<u>***朝廷委托***</u>工作并且在元朝一个帝国瓷器作坊被设立在景德镇。陶器扮演一个非常重要的部分在宗教仪式中。长且频繁的对于不同种类的瓷器<u>***抒情诗般的***</u>描述存在，协助瓷器的分类，尽管这些有时让一个已经很大且复杂的全景图困惑（凌乱）。

### Wrong again？

* **The tradition of religious sculpture extends over most historical periods but is less clearly delineated than that of stonewares or porcelains, for it embraces the old custom of earthenware burial ceramics with later religious images and architectural ornament.**

  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the **highlighted sentence** in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.

  A. While stonewares and porcelains are found throughout most historical periods, religious sculpture is limited to the ancient period.

  B. Religious sculpture was created in most periods, but its history is less clear than that of stonewares or porcelains because some old forms continued to be used even when new ones were developed.

  C. While stonewares and porcelains changed throughout history, religious sculpture remained uniform in form and use.

  D. The historical development of religious sculpture is relatively unclear because religious sculptures sometimes resemble earthenware architectural ornaments.

## Passage two: Variations in the Climate

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate. We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities.



Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records.

​       

Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are nonetheless some intriguing differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.
What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000 years (the Holocene period).



To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.



One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.



In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity. There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations. Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.
