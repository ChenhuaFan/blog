**这里所有的 it 都听不清。需要额外注意。**

**此外所有的 've 也都听不清**

## 连读导致的听不懂

* Well, I'll use the humming birds as an example.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27427_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  这里出现了经典的 I'll 连读。这里是 [you'll](/2019/03/10/TPO3-L3-精听记录/#3) 和 it'll 的对比。

* <u>You can't say it isn't.</u>

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74644_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  你不能说它不是——它是。

* Promoting ecological touris**<u>m is a</u>**nother way to help save their habitat.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27451_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  经典的 m-is-a 连读，不得不品尝。

* But to understand more about how to protec**<u>t and s</u>**upport humming birds **the best we can**, we**<u>'ve</u>** got to learn more about their breeding, ...

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27454_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

   The best we can. 很经典。

* <u>**That should**</u> help us determine how to prevent **further** decline in the population.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27455_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  That should 的连读，第一次见。此外 further 在第一次听的时候漏掉了。需要注意。

* Banding the birds **<u>allows us</u>** to track them **<u>over their</u>** lifetime. **<u>It's a</u>** practice **<u>that's</u>** been used by researchers for years.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27458_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  这一句也都是比较经典的连读，需要多加练习。

* In fact, most of what we've known about humming birds comes from banding studies, **<u>where we</u>** capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it, like its weight and age and length, **<u>are all recorded</u>**, put **<u>into</u>** international, an international information database.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27460_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  where 的读法 不是很熟悉。尤其是 where we 在一起，容易分不清；还有就是 are all 同理。

* Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming **<u>birds have worn them</u>** for years with no evidence of any problems.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74649_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

* One recaptured bird **<u>had been banded</u>** almost 12 years earlier - she is one of the oldest humming birds on record.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27466_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  体验一下，had been done。



## 句型或单词不熟悉导致的听不懂

* Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but even though it's really tiny, it migrates over very long distances, travels up and down the western hemisphere - the Americas, back and forth between <u>where it breeds in the summer</u> and <u>the warmer climates where it spends the winter.</u>

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74641_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  一个蛮长的句子，需要知道句子主要说了什么。

* Well, it does. It drinks a lot of **nectar** from flowers and **feeds on some insects**, but it's energy-efficient too.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74643_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  注意 some 的读法。

* <u>You can't say it isn't.</u> I mean, as it flies all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up almost none of its body fat.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74644_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  *中间那句意为：当它们飞过墨西哥湾时*

* **And it goes without saying,** but, well, the opposite is true as well, plants depend on humming birds too.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27440_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  这是不言而喻的。同时留心一下 opposite（相反的 对立的）

* Their **nesting** sites are affected too, <u>the same,</u> by the same sorts of human activities.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27445_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  *意：它们的筑巢区也受到同样的人类活动的影响。*

* <u>And one of the concrete ways people have been doing **this**</u> **is** by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27449_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  People have been doing this 做 ways 的后置定语。要同时注意 this is 之间很容易产生连读，s-is.

* So ecological tourism can bring financial rewards, <u>**all the more reason to value**</u> these beautiful little creatures in their habitat, right?

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74648_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  黑体字大意：**更加得到重视**

* And then we place **<u>an extremely</u>** lightweight band on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27461_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  一个腿 NMD 讲这么多，听不懂啊。





## 弱读 & 略读导致的听不懂

* There are, of course, animal species that require large **areas of habitat**, and some migrate **over** very long distances.

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/27424_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  这句话多听几遍就好.

* So we would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its habitat because on this long-distance journey, **it** needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?

  <audio src="https://img.kmf.com/qmmp3/3739/74642_20180606131012.mp3" controls></audio>

  这句话可以说能听得清楚 it 这个词了，发 [i] 的音。

* But the problem, well, as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or agriculture or cleared **for** raising cattle, **for** instance, there is less food available for migrating humming birds.
