# How to use *the* & *a*?
## Description:

### About "the"

1. Using *the* indicates that you're talking about something **specific** or **familiar**.
2. Sometimes, **unique nouns** are paired with the definite article *the*, When the noun is modified with a superlative (such as *most or best*) or an ordinal number (such as *first or seventh*), the noun becomes a unique item. Other adjectives may also create a unique noun in certain contexts (such as *the red car* in a parking lot full of blue cars. [this is a unique car according to the sentence.]).
3. **Don't use** *the* with **generic** or **abstract** ideas like <u>justice or creativity</u>.  
4. You also **shouldn't use** *the* before pronouns like *my, your* or *their*. 
5. Many proper nouns, such as personal names or place names, **don't require *the***.



### About "a"

1. The articles **a** and **an** are used with singular nouns to indicate that you're talking aobut any member of a particular category (e.g., *We saw a dog*).
