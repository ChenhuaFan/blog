## 解析部分：

1. **greatest prime factor 最大质因数**。小学白上。

   $$x=5$$

   $$180 = 2^{2} * 3^{2} * 5$$

   最大质因数是 5。

2. 吃鲸，$$0.5(x+20)=0.5x + 20$$，能写成这样，GRE 不用考试了。

   亲亲，建议**小学重修**。

   另外，这道题最后是 total number of games. 别忘记 $$x + 20$$。

3. **rounded to the nearest integer 四舍五入到最近整数**。

   $$ 2.5 < x < 3.5 $$

   范围开始写错了，不能是 $$x<3.4$$ 啊。

   亲亲，建议**小学重修**。

4. Number of Units in Stock
   库存数量
   Number of Units Sold as a Percent of Number of Units in Stock
   售出的数量为库存数量的百分比题目：R的电视比T的电视少卖了多少%所以需要结合表2和表1，先求出R和T分别卖了多少台电视！
   R台=50%*40=20台
   T台=90%*50=45台
   然后再算少卖了多少台：(R台-T台)/T台
   (20-45)/45=-55.5555%≈-56%

5. 草稿纸看错行了。

6. $$3x<2y<4z$$

   $$x<\frac{2}{3}y<\frac{4}{3}z$$

   $$ \frac{3}{2}x<y<\frac{4}{2}z$$

   $$ \frac{3}{4}x<\frac{2}{4}y<z$$

   可以得出

   $x$肯定小于$y$，其他的并不能比较出大小，存在相等的可能。
