### I [3 题]

1. One way to assess This is the American Earth, a collection of photographs selected and arranged by Nancy Newhall, is to apply Newhall's own criteria for judging photographic art.

   一种评价 This is the American Earth（一个由 Nancy Newhall 整理的相册集） 的方法是运用 Newhall 它自己的用于评价摄影艺术的标准。

   > **One way** (*to assess* ***This is the American Earth***), [~~a collection of photographs selected and arranged by Nancy Newhall~~], *is* to apply Newhall's own criteria for judging photographic art. 

2. Does this photographic essay achieve results impossible in other media? 

   这篇摄影随笔是否达到了(其他媒体无法达到的)效果? | 好长的后置定语

   > Does **this** **photographic essay** *achieve* <u>results</u> (impossible in other media)? 

3. By contrasting the small with the vast-for example, placing a photo of a rock pool next to one of a spiral galaxy- Newhall exploits the camera's ability to manipulate the size of an object, thereby challenging viewers to question their conventional concepts of size. 

   通过对比小和大，举个例子：放一张紧挨着银河的石头池子，Newhall 开发了相机的能力来操作物体的尺寸，因此挑战观测者来质疑他们对于尺寸的传统观念。

   > By contrasting the small with the vast [~~-for example, placing a photo of a rock pool next to one of a spiral galaxy-~~] **Newhall** *exploits* <u>the camera's ability</u> to manipulate the size of an object, thereby challenging viewers to question their conventional concepts of size. 

4. However, a similar result could be achieved in the medium of painting. 

   然而，一个相似的结果可以在画媒介上达到。**介词短语做宾语**

   > However, **a similar result** *could be achieved* <u>in the medium of painting</u>. 

5. ❓Does the work bear its creator's imprint, and does it draw viewers' interest even after repeated viewings, Newhall's second and third criteria? 

   这个作品拥有创造者的印记么？并且它即使在重复视角，Newhall 的第二个和第三个标准之后，画出了观测者的兴趣？**【啥意思啊】**

6. Indeed, Newhall's work bears her unmistakable imprint in the juxtaposition of the photos and in the rhythmic prose accompanying them, but the individual viewer must decide whether Newhall's work evokes, as it did for this reviewer, new experiences upon subsequent viewings.

   的确，纽霍尔的作品在照片的并列和与之相伴的有节奏的散文中，都带有她明确无误的印记，但个人观众必须决定，纽霍尔的作品是否能像这位评论家一样，在随后的观看中唤起新的体验。

   > Indeed, **Newhall's work** *bears* <u>her unmistakable imprint</u> in the juxtaposition of the photos and in the rhythmic prose accompanying them, but **the individual viewer** *must decide* whether Newhall's work evokes, as it did for this reviewer, new experiences upon subsequent viewings.

   ❓：还有一个问题，as it did for this reviewer 在句中做什么成分？

### II [2 题]

1. A 2004 scientific drilling expedition in the Arctic found an abundance of Azolla fern spores in samples of 50-million-year-old material from the seafloor. 

   一个 2004 科学的钻探展示发现了 Azolla fern spores 的大量存在。

   > **A 2004 scientific drilling expedition** in the Arctic *found* <u>an abundance of Azolla fern spores</u> in samples of 50-million-year-old material from the seafloor. 

2. Because the Azolla fern can grow only in freshwater, some scientists believe the spores originated in river deltas or lagoons and drifted into the Arctic Ocean. 

   因为 AF 仅能生长在淡水，一些科学家相信 spores 起源于河流三角洲或者 lagoons 并且漂流进大西洋。

   > Because **the Azolla fern** *can grow* only <u>in freshwater</u>, **some scientists** *believe* <u>(that) the spores originated in river deltas or lagoons and drifted into the Arctic Ocean.</u> 

3. However, Brinkhuis believes that the fern grew in a once-verdant ocean. 

   然而，Brinkhuis 相信 fern 生长在曾经翠绿的海洋

   > However, **Brinkhuis** *believes* that <u>the **fern** *grew* ***in a once-verdant ocean***.</u> 

4. ❓The sheer abundance of the spores makes it unlikely, [by some accounts], that they would have originated elsewhere. 

   ❌：这层 spores 的大量存在让这个理论不大可能，它们可能起源于别处。

   ✅：根据某些说法，孢子的数量之多使得它们不太可能起源于其他地方。

   > **❓The sheer abundance of the spores** *makes* <u>it</u> <u>unlikely</u>, [~~by some accounts~~], that they would have originated elsewhere. 

5. It is possible that geologic forces at one point closed the straits connecting other oceans to the Arctic Ocean, so water from rivers feeding into it pooled and formed a surface layer of freshwater where the fern could survive. 

   这是有可能的，地质力量在某一点闭合了连接其他洋和大西洋的海峡，因此从灌入大洋的河里来的水形成了一个淡水表层可供 fern 生存。**【灌入大洋的河里来的水 | 要多看看才可以。】**

   > It is possible that **geologic forces** at one point *closed* <u>the straits</u> connecting other oceans to the Arctic Ocean, so **water** from <u>rivers feeding into it</u> *pooled and formed* <u>a surface layer</u> of freshwater where the fern could survive. 

6. A later opening of the straits would have wiped out the fern.

   ❌：一个海峡的稍晚开启就会葬送这些 fern.

   ✅：如果晚些时候海峡开放，蕨类植物就会灭绝。
   
   > **A later opening of the straits** *would have wiped out* <u>the fern</u>.

### III [2 题]

1. While the golden age of English caricature (circa 1760–1820) is well documented, contemporaneous French caricature has been largely ignored, perhaps partly due to the artists' anonymity. 

   当英国的漫画艺术的黄金年代被很好的记录下来，法国的同时代的漫画艺术却被忽视了，也许因为艺术家的匿名。

   **❓：, perhaps partly due to the artists' anonymity.  在这里做什么成分？**

   > While **the golden age of English caricature** (circa 1760–1820) *is* <u>well documented</u>, **contemporaneous French caricature** *has been largely ignored*, perhaps partly due to the artists' anonymity.

   杰出的伦敦漫画家被同时代的人看做是艺术家和政治评论家.

3. French caricatures, however, were often unsigned and few archival resources provide information about those caricaturists whose names are known. 

   ❌：然而，法国漫画是经常不签名的并且很少档案的资源提供信息关于那些名字被知道的漫画家。

   ✅：然而，法国的漫画往往没有署名，而且很少有档案资料提供那些已知姓名的漫画家的资料。

   ‼️：问题在于 and 的并列弄错了，本以为是 unsigned 和什么adj 并列，但是却是 and 前面和后面两句话并列。

   > **French caricatures**, however, *were* <u>often unsigned and few archival resources</u> provide information about those caricaturists whose names are known. 

4. Records of the publishers of French caricature have survived more often than those of the artists. 

   那些出版商的档案似乎比艺术家的活的更好些。

   > **Records of the publishers of French caricature** *have survived* <u>more often</u> than those of the artists. 

5. Unlike in London, where publishers competed to work with celebrated caricaturists, publishers in Paris played a more prominent role in caricature production than artists and artisans. 

   不想在伦敦，巴黎的出版商在漫画产品中相比于艺术家和工匠扮演了一种更主要的的角色。

   > Unlike in London, [~~where publishers competed to work with celebrated caricaturists~~], **publishers in Paris** *played* <u>a more prominent role</u> in caricature production than artists and artisans. 

6. The names of publishers rather than artists often appear on the prints, perhaps in part because prints were often the work of several artisans.

   出版商的名字而不是艺术家经常出现在印刷品上，也许是因为印刷品经常是一系列工匠的作品。
   
   > **The names of publishers rather than artists** *often appear on* <u>the prints</u>, perhaps in part because prints were often the work of several artisans.

### IV [2 题]

1. Many scholars view the 1892 arrival of the boll weevil, a destructive agricultural pest, as a drastic shock to the economic routine of the cotton-dependent American South, and as one trigger of the Great Migration of African Americans to the North in search of employment opportunities. 

   许多学者把 1892 年boll weevil (BW)的到来看做是对美国南部棉花经济的冲击 并且是 一次大迁徙的开端。

   > **Many scholars** *view* <u>the 1892 arrival of the boll weevil</u>, [~~a destructive agricultural pest~~], (as a drastic shock to the economic routine of the cotton-dependent American South, and as one trigger of the Great Migration of African Americans to the North in search of employment opportunities. )

2. However, Higgs argues that such accounts exaggerate the insect's impact on the southern cotton industry specifically and on the southern economy as a whole. 

   然而，H 争论说：那些陈述特别地夸大了昆虫对于南部棉花工业的影响，并且南部经济也是一样（都被夸大了）。

   > However, **Higgs** *argues* <u>that such accounts exaggerate the insect's impact on the southern cotton industry specifically and on the southern economy as a whole.</u> 

3. His fundamental point is that the reductions in supply caused by the weevil led to offsetting increases in prices paid to cotton farmers. 

   他的基础观点是：由 BW 导致的供应量的缩减导致抵消了支付给棉花农民价格的增长。

   > **His fundamental point** *is* <u>that the **reductions** in supply caused by the weevil *led to* ***offsetting increases*** in prices paid to cotton farmers.</u> 

4. In Higgs's view the boll weevil infestation was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition underlying the Great Migration. 

   在 H 看来，BW 的大量滋生既不是必要的也不是充分的构成大迁徙的基础条件。

   > In Higgs's view **the boll weevil infestation** *was* neither a necessary nor a sufficient <u>condition</u> underlying the Great Migration. 

5. And as Giesen observed, the South produced more cotton in 1921 than in 1892.

   并且就 G 的观察，南部在 1921 年产出了更多的棉花相比于 1892 年。
