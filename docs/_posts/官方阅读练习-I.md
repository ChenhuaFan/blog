Angel DeCora, the best-known Native American artist in the United States before World War I, is rarely discussed by **early historians of Native American art**. [2]<u>These historians valued what they considered authenticity, defined as an ***absence*** of modern and European influences.</u> DeCora was educated by some of the country\`s leading European American artists, and she used European elements such as vanishing-point perspective to depict Native American subjects. <u>[1]***Hutchinson*** argues that this should not preclude DeCora\`s work from being considered Native American art.</u> She suggests that by representing the intersection between Native American and European American culture, DeCora\`s work challenged the European American view of Native American culture as belonging only to the past, presenting instead an image of survival and adaptation.

1. It can be inferred that ***Hutchinson*** would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about Native American art?

   -  It is unlikely to develop further in the direction charted by Angel DeCora.
   -  It has been misrepresented by art historians who apply European criteria to art that was not intended to reflect European aesthetic values.
   -  It is most authentic when it uses traditional Native American methods to depict traditional Native American subject matter.
   -  It has traditionally used European elements in ways that differ from the use that European American artists make of those elements.
   -  **It can adopt new elements in response to changing cultural conditions and still remain Native American art.**

   **解析：**

   题干中关键名词：***Hutchinson***，可以定位到原文中的

   > [1] <u>***Hutchinson*** argues that this should not preclude DeCora\`s work from being considered Native American art.</u>

   结合前文所说

   > [2] <u>These historians valued what they considered authenticity, defined as an ***absence*** of modern and European influences.</u> 

   因此，可以确定 H 反对之前历史学家的说法。新元素也应该是美国本土艺术文化

2. The passage suggests which of the following about the "**early historians of Native American art**" mentioned in the passage?

   -  Their views of Native American art were strongly influenced by Native Americans` criteria for determining whether art authentically represented their cultures.
   -  Their criteria for judging the authenticity of Native American art gave primacy to subject matter over technique.
   -  They included in histories of Native American art only works created prior to the period of Native Americans` contact with Europeans.
   -  **They would regard the use of vanishing-point perspective as an inauthentic element in a painting by a Native American artist.**
   -  They were probably familiar with Angel DeCora`s art but unaware that she was Native American.

   **解析：**
   * > Their views of Native American art were strongly influenced by Native Americans` criteria for <u>determining whether art authentically represented their cultures</u>.
   
     A 选项易错，一开始也选的是 A。但是仔细阅读发现：是否能称之为美国本土艺术与能否反应他们的文化没有关系。详情可以参考文中关于早起历史学家的描述：
   
     > [2] <u>These historians valued what they considered authenticity, defined as an ***absence*** of modern and European influences.</u>
   
   * > Their criteria for judging the authenticity of Native American art gave primacy to subject matter over technique.
   
     B 这个原文中没有提及有关于技巧技术的事儿。
   
   * > They included in histories of Native American art only works created prior to the period of Native Americans` contact with Europeans.
   
     C 选项 prior to 在…之前。所以大意是：它们只包括在美洲原住民与欧洲人接触之前创作的作品。
   
     可见和原文所说意思不一致
   
   * > They would regard the use of vanishing-point perspective as an inauthentic element in a painting by a Native American artist.
   
     首先定位 **vanishing-point perspective** 到文中，可以发现：Decora 使用 vpp 来描述美国本土事务。
   
     > DeCora was educated by some of the country\`s leading European American artists, and she used European elements such as ***vanishing-point perspective*** to depict Native American subjects.
   
     然后选项 **inauthentic** 表明这不是美国本土艺术，因此符合早起历史学家的想法。
   
     > These historians valued what they considered authenticity, defined as an ***absence*** of modern and European influences.
   
     DC 使用的 VPP 手法是来自欧洲的而不是美国。
   
   * > They were probably familiar with Angel DeCora`s art but unaware that she was Native American.
   
   
   
   Herman Melville\`s description of the social arrangement of sperm whales in *Moby-Dick* is remarkably similar to other\` description of more familiar mammals, where males dominate a group of females, fight off interloping males, and breed with the females in the harem. This arrangement is found in a variety of mammals, including such diverse species as elephant seals, elk, lions, and even chimpanzees, but it does not apply to sperm whales. **Would you really expect sperm whales, different in almost every respect from all other mammals, to conform to some sort of behavioral norm?** Of course not, and they don\`t, but there is a surprising similarity to another huge mammal. In what they call "A Colossal Convergence," Weilgart, Whitehead, and Payne describe the remarkable similarities between the sperm whale, the largest toothed whale, and the largest terrestrial mammal, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Just as sperm whales are able **to communicate over long distances**, so too can elephants. Females announce their availability for breeding by sending out a series of low-pitched calls, and reproductively receptive males converge from all directions. Elephant calls, far below the range of human hearing, also serve to attract distant family members to the scene of excitement, distress, or separation. Elephants and sperm whales have unusual but remarkably similar life history parameters, wide-ranging behavior, and ecological success, as well as the largest brains, respectively, on land and in the ocean. Their societies are based on matrilineal groups of about ten related females that often form temporary associations, of a few days or so, with other female groups. After leaving their mot\`er`s group when they are about six years old, male sperm whales become increasingly solitary and range to higher latitudes as they grow to about one and a half times the length and three times the weight of females-the most extreme case of sexual size dimorphism among cetaceans. Another striking parallel with elephants is in the delayed age of effective breeding by males: although male elephants and sperm whales become sexually mature during their late teens, they do not seem to take a significant role in breeding until their late twenties. In the case of elephants, this is because younger males do not enter the behaviorally dominant but physiologically demanding state of musth [a periodic condition characterized by heightened aggression] in the prime breeding season. Male sperm whales in the same age range usually remain in productive high-latitude waters, away from the tropical breeding grounds of the females. In these highly sexually dimorphic species, it probably pays younger males to concentrate on growth rather than competing with their much larger elders for the few breeding opportunities presented by slowly reproducing females, who might bear one young every four or five years.
