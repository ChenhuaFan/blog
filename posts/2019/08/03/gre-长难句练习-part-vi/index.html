&quot;did not&quot; participate in the Romantic &quot;spirit of the age&quot; but instead embraced an alternative ideology that Mellor labels &quot;<strong>feminine Romanticism</strong>.&quot;</li> <li><strong>To be sure, some critics throughout the years have argued for Austen's affinities with one or more of the male Romantic poets.</strong></li> <li>A special issue of the Wordsworth Circle (Autumn 1976) was devoted to exploring connections between Austen and her male contemporaries.</li> <li>Clifford Siskin in his historicist study of Romanticism argued that Austen does participate in the same major innovation, the naturalization of belief in a developing self, as characterizes Wordsworth's poetry and other key works from the period.</li> <li>Recently, three books have appeared (by Clara Tuite, William Galperin, and William Deresiewicz) that in various ways treat Austen as a Romantic writer and together signal a shift in the tendency to segregate the major novelist of the age from the major poets.</li> <li>The <strong>present essay</strong> seeks to contribute to this goal of firmly integrating Austen within the Romantic movement and canon.</li> <li>It does so by pointing out affinities between Austen and a writer with whom she has not commonly been associated: John Keats.</li> <li>Most comparisons of Austen and the Romantic poets have focused on Wordsworth and Byron, whose works we know she read.</li> <li>Although Austen could not have read Keats's poems, which only began to appear in print during the last years of her life, and there is no evidence that Keats knew Austen's novels, a number of important similarities can be noted in these writers' works that provide further evidence to link Austen with the Romantic movement, especially the period of second-generation Romanticism when all of her novels were published.</li></ol> <h3 id="ii-i"><a href="#ii-i" class="header-anchor">#</a> II-I</h3> <p>According to the passage, compared to critics trained in &quot;<strong>historicist and feminist criticism,</strong>&quot; earlier critics of Austen were</p> <p>😢 more likely to represent her as isolated from the major intellectual currents of her period</p> <p>😢 more likely to represent her as departing from Augustan modes of thought</p> <p>😢 more likely to find connections between her novels and Romantic poetry</p> <p>😢 less likely to neglect the influence of Romantic ideology on her work</p> <p>😢 less likely to notice affinities between Austen and her female counterparts</p> <h3 id="ii-ii"><a href="#ii-ii" class="header-anchor">#</a> II-II</h3> <p>According to the passage, the &quot;<strong>present essay</strong>&quot; parallels Siskin's study in which of the following ways?</p> <p>😢 It aims to challenge Austen's position in the Romantic movement by showing connections between Austen and an Augustan poet.</p> <p>😢 It aims to situate Austen within the Romantic movement by studying connections between Austen and a Romantic male novelist.</p> <p>😢 It aims to characterize Austen as a second-generation Romantic writer by showing how Austen participated in the naturalization of belief in a developing self.</p> <p>😢 It aims to situate Austen within the Romantic movement by studying connections between Austen's writings and those of a Romantic poet.</p> <p>😢 It aims to break new ground in Austen studies by studying the influence on Austen's work of a second-generation Romantic writer.</p> <h3 id="ii-iii"><a href="#ii-iii" class="header-anchor">#</a> II-III</h3> <p><strong>For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.</strong></p> <p>The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the concept of &quot;<strong>feminine Romanticism</strong>&quot;?</p> <p>😢 It does little to alleviate Austen's vexed relationship to Romanticism.</p> <p>😢 It segregates her from male writers whose poetry is central to the Romantic period.</p> <p>😢 It implies that Austen eventually embraced the Romantic ideology.</p> <h3 id="ii-iv"><a href="#ii-iv" class="header-anchor">#</a> II-IV</h3> <p>Which of the following best describes the function of the <strong>highlighted sentence</strong> in the context of the passage as a whole?</p> <p>😢 It emphasizes the widespread interest in connections between Austen and the Romantic poets.</p> <p>😢 It concedes a methodological limitation in the prevailing approach to characterizing Austen's relationship to Romanticism.</p> <p>😢 It reconciles contrasting views about Austen's relationship to Romanticism.</p> <p>😢 It questions the validity of the claims made in the previous paragraph.</p> <p>😢 It acknowledges some exceptions to the critical trend described in the first paragraph.</p> <h2 id="iii"><a href="#iii" class="header-anchor">#</a> III</h2> <ol><li>In Bronze Age farm fields near the ancient circle of stones at Stonehenge, the furrows were found plowed at right angles to an imaginary line to the place where the Sun rises on the shortest day of the year.</li> <li>Some of the major stones at Stonehenge are also aligned, apparently intentionally, with that point on the horizon.</li> <li>Since these fields date from shortly after Stonehenge was completed, the plowing was probably consciously guided according to systematic observation of the Sun's position.</li></ol> <h3 id="iii-i"><a href="#iii-i" class="header-anchor">#</a> III-I</h3> <p>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?</p> <p>😢 The landscape in which these fields were situated made it more difficult to plow in the direction in which the furrows were plowed than in other directions.</p> <p>😢 The direction of the plowing on any other Bronze Age farm fields near Stonehenge cannot be determined because of the deep plowing that has taken place in modern times.</p> <p>😢 Bronze Age farmers had primitive plows that were not capable of turning over soils heavier than those in the fields near Stonehenge.</p> <p>😢 The Bronze Age farm fields near Stonehenge were laid out in clusters that were not immediately next to other such clusters.</p> <p>😢 Even before Stonehenge was built, farmers in the area could have made a practice of observing the Sun's position at various times of year.</p> <h2 id="iv"><a href="#iv" class="header-anchor">#</a> IV</h2> <ol><li>The gap between crime and punishment in preindustrial England has long puzzled historians.</li> <li>Although most criminal trials involved felonies for which the penalty was execution, relatively few convicted criminals were actually executed.</li> <li>This distance between potential and actual applications of the law was traditionally thought to demonstrate the inefficiency of premodern legal systems: historians assumed that before the late eighteenth century, the &quot;success&quot; rates of courts were minimal because the legal system had to function without a modern legal bureaucracy.</li> <li>Recently, however, the history of legal development has been seen as something other than an increasing administrative ability to apply sentences.</li> <li>Acknowledging, as their predecessors had not, that law enforcement must be understood within a historically specific social context, recent scholars have suggested that, in a non-democratic society, selective enforcement was a valuable tool of class power: a discretionary legal system enabled the ruling classes to maintain social control by exercising a paternalistic power to grant or to deny mercy as they wished.</li></ol> <h3 id="iv-i"><a href="#iv-i" class="header-anchor">#</a> IV-I</h3> <p>According to the passage, which of the following was true of felonies in preindustrial England?</p> <p>😢 They were the only type of crime routinely punished by execution.</p> <p>😢 They were the only type of crime with regard to which discretionary sentencing was practiced.</p> <p>😢 They were the type of crime in response to which an unwieldy bureaucracy became necessary.</p> <p>😢 They were the type of crime most often granted clemency.</p> <p>😢 They were the type of crime that accounted for most criminal trials.</p> <h3 id="iv-ii"><a href="#iv-ii" class="header-anchor">#</a> IV-II</h3> <p>The main historical question discussed in the passage is the reason for the gap between</p> <p>😢 felony laws in contemporary society and felony laws in preindustrial England</p> <p>😢 eighteenth-century legal scholarship and modern legal practices</p> <p>😢 premodern methods of social control and contemporary methods of social control</p> <p>😢 crimes whose sentences were routinely enforced and crimes for which clemency was routinely granted</p> <p>😢 sentences that the courts were able to impose by law and sentences actually carried out</p> <h3 id="iv-iii"><a href="#iv-iii" class="header-anchor">#</a> IV-III</h3> <p>It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers which of the following to be a salient characteristic of modern legal systems?</p> <p>😢 A hesitance on the part of law enforcement officials to seek execution for felons</p> <p>😢 A tendency initially to seek severe sentences for felons, but then to accept more lenient sentences later</p> <p>😢 A tendency to interpret laws within the social contexts that give rise to them</p> <p>😢 An administrative system that enables the legal system to enforce sentencing</p> <p>😢 A bureaucracy that discriminates against certain criminals by arbitrarily granting or denying leniency</p></div> <div id="comment-container" class="theme-default-content"></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
