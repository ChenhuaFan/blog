The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal. Famous explorers of the north American frontier, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, deer populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas, Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:&quot; The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone ?in 1832?, hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.&quot;</p> <p><strong>The author tells the story of the explorers Lewis and Clark in paragraph 3 in order to illustrate which of the following points?</strong></p> <p>A. The number of deer within the Puget Sound region has varied over time.</p> <p>B. Most of the explorers who came to the Puget Sound area were primarily interested in hunting game.</p> <p>C. There was more game for hunting in the East of the United States than in the West.</p> <p>D. Individual explorers were not as successful at locating games as were the trading companies.</p></li> <li><p>**1-7：**Reduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times. A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further. Recall <u><strong>the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer</strong>,</u> now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, says that &quot;since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period.&quot;</p> <p><em>Why does the author ask readers to recall <strong>&quot;<u>the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer</u>&quot;</strong> in the discussion of changes in the wilderness landscape?</em></p> <p>A. To provide support for the idea that habitat destruction would lead to population decline</p> <p>B. To compare how two species of deer caused biotic changes in the wilderness environment</p> <p>C.

The activities of settlers contributed in unexpected ways to the growth of some deer populations in later times.</p> <p>C. The cleaning of wilderness land for construction caused biotic changes from which the black-tailed deer population has never recovered.</p> <p>D. Since the 1940s the winter populations of deer have fluctuated more than the summer populations have.</p></li> <li><p>**1-11：**The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions. First, the major predators of deer-wolves, cougar, and lynx-have been greatly reduced in numbers. Second, conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer. <strong>In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive.</strong> The protein content of shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings.</p> <p><em>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the <strong>highlighted sentence</strong> in the passage?

The balance of deer species in the Puget Sound region has changed over time, with the Columbian white-tailed deer now outnumbering other types of deer.</p> <p>B. Deer populations naturally fluctuate, but early settlers in the Puget Sound environment caused an overall decline in the deer populations of the areas at that time.</p> <p>C. In the long term, black-tailed deer in the Puget Sound area have benefitted from human activities through the elimination of their natural predators, and more and better food in deforested areas.</p> <p>D. Because Puget Sound deer migrate, it was and still remains difficult to determine accurately how many deer are living at any one time in the western United States.</p> <p>E.

This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings.

The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people. Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming extinct), the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals.</p> <p><strong>According to paragraph 4, which of the following may best represent the attitude of hunters toward deer and reindeer in the Upper Paleolithic period?</strong></p> <p>A. Hunters did not fear deer and reindeers as much as they did large game animals such as horses and mammoths.</p> <p>B. Hunters were not interested in hunting deer and reindeer because of their size and speed.</p> <p>C. Hunters preferred the meat and hides of deer and reindeer to those of other animals.</p> <p>D. Hunters avoided deer and reindeer because of their natural weapons, such as horns.</p></li> <li><p>**3-8：**As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the search for it is extended into more-hostile environments. The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean's continental shelves-those gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway.</p> <p><strong>What does the development of the Alaskan oil field mentioned in paragraph 4 demonstrate?</strong></p> <p><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-times" style="color:red;"></i> A. More oil is extracted from the sea than from land.</p> <p>B. Drilling for oil requires major financial investments.</p> <p>C. The global demand for oil has increased over the years.</p> <p>D.
